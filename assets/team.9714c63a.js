During her undergraduate studies, she worked as a research assistant with Prof. Jonas Obleser at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (Auditory Cognition group), examining the effects of feedback on perception and behaviour. During her medical studies, she developed a deep interest in neurological and psychiatric diseases and their pathophysiology, diagnostics and treatment. A short internship at Prof. Bogdan Draganski's Research in Neuroimaging (LREN) lab in Lausanne (Switzerland) gave her insight into neuroimaging data analysis and motivated her to pursue research in this field after her medical studies. 
She joined the Dagher lab in July 2022 and examines the relationship between genetic risk of neurodegenerative diseases (especially Parkinson\u2019s disease) and brain morphology. For her analyses, she works with large datasets like the UK Biobank.`,

His work relates to the psychology field of embodied cognition (Cisek P., and Pastor-Bernier A., 2014), motivated choice and neuroeconomics in both primates and humans (Pastor-Bernier, Stasiak A., and Schultz W). His work includes electrophysiological and utility theory modelling of multiple-component rewards and reward-specific satiety in both primates and humans: Pastor-Bernier et al., 2021-2017). Dr Pastor-Bernier is interested in studying value computational mechanisms underlying vulnerability to disease including disorders of motivation and self-control like addiction and disorders where apathy and anhedonia predominate like depression and Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD). In Dr Dagher\u2019s lab at the Montreal Neurological institute (MNI-BIC), Alex is conducting a perceptual-discrimination neuroimaging study with Dr Qin Tau investigating the phenotypic traits that predispose humans to impulsive behaviour (urgency signaling). He is also studying how tractography phenotypes (DTI) manifest with genetic propensities for dysfunctional dopaminergic function in Alzheimer disease (AD) and PD in UKBB, Prevent_AD and QPN databases.",
